If you're playing as Bios (this can be done with other teams as well, but is most useful to Bios), 
the research time is ten minutes (600 seconds). This means that, because of the way the F5 menu 
(investments) works, a commander will have to invest as much as he can into a single option (a research 
upgrade, for example) when he clicks 'Invest'. This results in all his money taking 10 minutes before paying 
off. His other option is to hand money to an investor, who can invest little amounts of money into multiple 
upgrades, resulting in a much better use of the money. In Allegiance, investing even 1$ into a research will 
begin the research, but only for 1$'s worth. If you place $2,500 in a $5,000 research, the research will 
proceed until it is halfway done, at which point you must invest money again.
