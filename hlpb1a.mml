    <Bullet|hlpimg1|Launch SOVRoute, following the instruction in the tutorial above.>
    <Bullet|hlpimg2|Launch Allegiance.>
    <Bullet|hlpimg3|On the Allegiance main menu, click LAN Games.>
    <Bullet|hlpimg4|The "Find Server" dialog box appears with the currently running servers. This should be almost instantenous, if the servers aren't there in a few seconds, they won't appear. Don't be fooled by the term "Searching" - it will not find a server that wasn't running at the time you clicked LAN Games.>
    <Bullet|hlpimg5|If the search is successful, servers that you can access will be listed. Click on the one you want to join, type in your name and join.>
