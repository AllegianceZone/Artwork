<Font|headerFont>STEALTH BOMBING:<p>With Technoflux<Font|helpFont><p><p>

Technoflux stealth bombers use an anti-base weapon. They dont need to arm missiles, and so don't raise their signature either. When you get in range, keep your shield down, change from regular cloak to heavy cloak (CTRL-8), and fire from as far as possible. You'll never get seen. Even defending pilots can't guess where the TF SBs are, since the bombers don't fire missiles that could betray their position. Note however that the weapon's firing signature is extremely high, and so try to remain as far from the station as possible.

<p><p>Stations where you should go straight and alone are refineries (including special refineries), teleport receivers and light outposts. They are very difficult to defend against surprise attacks because they go down quickly. Other stations, such as outposts, heavy outposts and most importantly tech bases, usually require many stealth bombers and positioning before a synchronized assault. They are usually well defended, heavily defended and resistant. An IC garrison can take up to 10 anti-base missiles, for example.

<p><p>Note that any kind of stealth bombing depends heavily on the technology available. A basic signature cloak with no signature upgrades and anti-base missile 1 will be more tricky to use than signature cloak 3, heavy cloak 2, all signature upgrades and energy upgrades and anti-base missile 3. This is how you decide whether you can take down an enemy tech station alone or if you'll need to be 5 pilots to do it.
