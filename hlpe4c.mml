<Font|headerFont>BOMBING: With Rix<Font|helpFont><p><p>

The Rixians differ in that they do not make use of missiles, but of the EW Stinger, a powerful energy weapon. This difference allows rixian bombers, called ballistas, to never run out of anti-base equipment, and they therefore never need to reload them. Also, since no missile has to be placed in cargo, all the room may be dedicated to ammo packs for the turrets, and no missile can be armed to raise the bomber's signature. Finally, as an additional advantage, scouts can ripcord to each other. This allows destroyed nans to be rescued quickly and teleport back as a brand new nan in a matter of seconds. Also, if the bomber lacks ammo (if the bomber run has been particularly long and animated), the nans can ripcord to a base, dock, get ammo, and ripcord back to give the ammo to the ballista. 

<p><p>When attacking a station, the ballista will never need to reload missiles. Continous firing results in faster destruction. One problem, characteristic of all energy based weapons, is that when the energy runs out, it can take a long time before you get significant amounts of energy left, which can be a problem if the Stinger is not powerful enough, and/or the target station's shields/hull are too strong. Spending 20 seconds recharging energy by an enemy station while taking heavy interceptor fire is not a good thing.
