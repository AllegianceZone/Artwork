<Font|headerFont>HIDDEN SHIPS<Font|helpFont><p><p>
When the enemy uses any kind of stealth technology that is threatening one of your stations, it's much better to detect it and destroy it. Usually, EWS probes won't suffice in detecting these stealth ships, and you must therefore use scouts. Of course, you don't always know if a stealth ship is in your sector, and you certainly won't start searching for one if you didn't see one enter.

<p><p><Font|smallBoldFont>Situation:<Font|helpFont> A stealth bomber was detected for a period of approximately one second in the sector where your expansion complex is placed. Most of your teammates get out with interceptors, using pulse probes to try and detect the enemy, but they fail. The sb is probably hiding behind an asteroid. Your commander gave the team a waypoint to where the sb was seen. You are smart and take a scout, equipped with a full load of pulse probes, and 2 seeker missiles. As you are out, you use your pulse probes in the region where the sb was seen, while investigating nearby asteroids. 
<p><p>The sb shouldn't stand a chance, and will either ripcord, or start the assault before it is too late. Since there are many interceptors already deployed nearby, and you to spot him, there is no way he can succeed. The pulse probes should suffice. Even with a heavy cloak, the sb should run out of energy before you run out of probes, and become visible. You can use your missiles and weapon to destroy it.
