<Font|headerFont>NANNING: PART 2<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Font|subheaderFont>3) AHEAD MINE LAYING<Font|helpFont>

<p><p>When the bomber has been spotted and defending ships are rushing to it, one or two nans may go in front of the bomber, in the defenders' flight path, and lay mines, to disrupt their activities and possibly damage/destroy their ships. The nan must then return to the bomber and assist to its repair. Note that smart defenders will have no trouble taking out a nan flying a bit too far from the bomber, so don't do this too often, and get back to the bomber as soon as possible.

<p><p><Font|subheaderFont>4) NANNING<Font|helpFont>

<p><p>The nans work in large groups. The more there are, the more time it will take the defenders to destroy most of them before they can inflict significant damage to the bomber. Nans have one purpose: delay the bomber's destruction enough so that the target station is destroyed. If possibe, they must ensure the bomber's survival while it is ripcording out of the sector, either before (failure of the bomber run: the enemy forces are clearly superior and attakers have decided to retreat) or after (success of the bomber run) a station is destroyed. In order for the nans to remain alive as long as possible, they must use their sidethrusters (and boosters for Belter nans) to avoid enemy fire, while using countermeasures to flee from missiles and mines to destroy enemy ships and disrupt their defending activities. It will however occur very often that the bomber will be destroyed before the target is destroyed. Try and hide your scout for rescue the pods later.
