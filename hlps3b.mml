<Font|headerFont>WEAPONS & EQUIPMENT<Font|helpFont><p><p>

Each ship has a default loadout configuration that is appropriate
for its ship class. You can completely modify the loadout if you desire.
Keep an eye on the changes to your ship's performance envelope as you add
new items and remove others. Dropping the additional booster fuel might
save you some weight and give you slightly higher acceleration but, in the
midst of a nasty firefight, having the extra booster fuel is all that
might stand between your survival and an extremely slow eject pod.<p><p>

Your ship loadout will allow you to
modify most of the following Loadout categories:<p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Weapons mounts<Font|helpFont>
support only weapons, either ammo-based or energy-based.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Missile bays<Font|helpFont> allow you to mount specific
missiles on your chosen ship. Different ship classes have different
missile options.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Turret mounts<Font|helpFont> are
available on most capital ships and bombers.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Equipment slots<Font|helpFont> will
vary from ship to ship. Each of the five equipment slots can support
the ship with a different type of equipment: boosters, shields, cloaks,
probes and mines, and countermeasures.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Cargo bays<Font|helpFont> allow you to carry spare
equipment that you may be able to mount while in-flight using your <Main|hlps5|Inventory display>
or equipment to deliver to other ships. Carrying expendable items such as
ammo,
fuel, probes, mines, missiles, and countermeasures makes the best use of
your cargo bays.><p><p>

A slot with a red circle with a line through it means that you
do not have access to that slot. As you peruse through the various available ships,
you'll notice that different classes of ships have different available
slots. Slot Empty means you can load something into that ship's
slot.<p><p>
