<p><p><Font|subheaderFont>IDEAL SETTINGS
    <p><p><Bullet|hlpbullet|The lower the better, bios tech is very cheap and doesn't require large amounts of money to keep the research going. You may need to forgo getting certain garr tech in order to get a tech, but the low money settings will hurt the enemy a lot more then it hurts you.>
<p><p><Font|subheaderFont>FACTION STRATEGIES
    <p><p><Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Supremacy/Garrison<Font|helpFont> - Bios has one of the best fighters in the game due to hitbox and gunmounts, they also have one of the best hvy bombers due to having heavy cloak, they can almost be used as sbs in certain situations. Always get heavy cloak 2 as bios it will help any tech path. The quicker you can get a Sup, the better, a lot of comms have the habbit of spending too much cash right away into the garrison. Get adv scouts, get bombers, get tp1(for sup anyways), and get heavy cloak 2. If you are playing against tac, start the enh miner. Yes the tech doesnt seem to cost a lot, but it adds up quickly and before you know it, you're getting a tech at 20min+, this means by the time you get mk2 tech, the enemy could almost have two mk3 techs. Heavy bombers with xrm ab's can sneak into a sector and potentialy kill the base without ever getting eyed(using the asteroid as a sheild). Bios tp2 is awsome due to the low sig scouts being able to sneak into anywhere and being able to rip cloaked bbrs into a sector. Bios is more about timing then overpowering the enemy, it makes them a bit tricky to comm.>
    <p><p><Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Tp1 Rush<Font|helpFont> - A nearly extinct strategy, but by 10min and with a properly placed tp1 probe(behind a rock) you can rip in a fully nanned bombing run straight into the enemy's home.>
    <p><p><Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Tactical<Font|helpFont> - Like most tacs, bios is extremely weak at the beginning so it is rarely used as a primary tech. Use of gunships does make it easier to defend, but the purchase of GS often will tie up a large amount of players when they should be out killing miners. Most often, Bios tac is used for an end tactic for supremacy. Bios' ab3 stealth bombers are up there with Rix's sbs for best in the game.>
    <p><p><Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Expansion<Font|helpFont> - This tech is dependant on what the team picks up. Due to the larger hitbox and poor gunmounts of the bios int, defending can be difficult with mg1, I usualy only go Bios exp if the team finds mg2. Although their heavy ints arn't bad, they can't compete with GT, IC, and Rix's ints. The redeeming factor to bios exp, is their incredible HTTs. The Bios HTT can carry heavy cloak enabling it to sneak up to the enemy base and get eyed around 1-1.5k if used properly.>
