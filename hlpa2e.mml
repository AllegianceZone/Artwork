<Font|headerFont>HELP MENU<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>

This Help Menu was primarily created to provide quick in-game answers.  While it does contain a lot of information, it is only
a fraction of the information that can be found on the <Main|hlpa2c|Allegiance Academy> website located at<Hyperlink|www.allegacademy.org|http://www.allegacademy.org/index.shtml><Color|white>.  You should already be familiar
with the basics of Allegiance and use this if your team/commander needs you to perform a task that you are not quite sure how to
do and need something to refresh your memory.<p><p>
Clicking on orange text will take you to the help section on that topic while green text will display information in the lower portion of the help menu.<p><p>
Commanders should point novices to the help menu's <Main|hlpe0|QUICK REFERENCE> section (or elsewhere if necessary) when they are needed to perform
tasks such as scouting, nanning, etc and don't know how to do so.
