<Font|helpFont>
Once you have created or joined a game at its beginning, you are taken to the Team Lobby<Color|white> from the Games List. The Team 
Lobby is where all pre-game strategy typically happens -- where you discuss what team you will play for, who the members 
are on each team, and what roles the different players will be playing. <p><p>At the top of the Team Lobby, your player status 
and that of your team are shown. If you have not joined a team, a message here states that you need to do so.
