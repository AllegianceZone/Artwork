The Refinery Platform processes raw minerals deposited by nearby miners.
This returns income to the team. All stations have this basic
capability, but these small, automated platforms are easy to establish in
remote spots and fiscally represent a low risk. Miners will always land at
the base or Refinery Platform closest to the rock they are mining.
