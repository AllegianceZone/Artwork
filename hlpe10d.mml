<Font|headerFont>SIGNATURE:<p>Making a Difference<Font|helpFont><p><p>

Keeping your shields and missiles down makes a huge difference. Let's take the example of the stealth fighter. Fully equipped, a stealth fighter will have a signature of approximately 200%. However, taking shields and missiles down will reduce the signature to 50%. Then, you can cloak, which can reduce your signature to as low as 12% approximately, enabling you to pass by probes and interceptors as close as 100m. 

<p><p>This is why, after destroying a target like a miner, a pilot takes his shields and missiles down and cloaks, allowing him to remain undetected even though he's surrounded by enemy defending ships. You can also use a heavy cloak, taking your signature to levels as low as 7%, almost having to collide with the enemy before being detected.
