//custombrief.mdl
//Made by Andon for Zone Game and Event implementation
//This was made so that the Zone Game team could implement custom briefing messages without
//having to use the AutoUpdate feature for a ton of files each time. They would simply have
//to update this file with the desired briefing and have the core directed towards the
//appropriate briefing. Due to the nature of Allegiance, only six custom briefings will ever
//be needed for a single event - therefore there are only six of them. This file also ensures
//that players will not have their games broken by a well-meaning Events team.
//
//Please note that the additional custom briefing files (briefingimage.mdl, customXlobbybmp.mdl,
//customXloadoutpanebmp.mdl, customXhullinfobmp.mdl, and iconcustomXbmp.mdl) are integral to
//the functioning of this file, and they should not be tampered with.
//
//Briefing Images:
//These are contained in the briefingimage.mdl file. While I could include them in here, it's 
//simply easier to put them in there.
//There are three image types: Lobby images, Loadout background images, and F6/Briefing images.
//Lobby images are the background shown in the lobby
//Loadout background images are shown in the ship loadout screen
//F6/Briefing images are shown at the mission briefing and in the F6 pane.
//
//Each faction has a prefix. These are as follows:
//Belters: belt
//Bios: bios
//Dreghklar: dreg
//Ga'Taraan: gt
//Gigacorp: giga
//Iron Coalition: ic
//Rixian: rix
//Technoflux: tf
//Faction X: fx //Please note that Faction X is not implemented yet and will cause most people to crash
//IC Rookies: rook
//Phoenix: pnx
//Effix: effix
//Omicron Hive: oh //Please note that Omicron Hive is not implemented yet and will cause most people to crash
//Colonials: col
//Earth: earth
//Jupiter: jup
//Mars: mars
//Saturn: sat
//Venus: ven
//Galactic Empire: ge
//Rebel Alliance: ra
//
//Please note that the prefix must be in all lowercase letters in order to function.
//
//To form an image reference, simply attach a prefix to the type of image.
//For example, the Belter images are beltlobby beltloadout and belticon for the lobby, loadout,
//and icon respectively.
//
//There are also these "default" or blank images:
//deflobby: Blank lobby image
//defloadout: Blank loadout image
//yellowicon: Yellow F6 icon
//blueicon: Blue F6 icon
//purpleicon: Purple F6 icon
//greenicon: Green F6 icon
//redicon: Red F6 icon (really more like pink)
//whiteicon: white F6 icon (really more like mint)
//
//And for when Squads are used, there are also these squad prefixes. Squads have lobby, loadout, and icon images.
//Squad images are found in the artwork\squadimages folder, but they are defined in the brifingimage.mdl file
//
//Black Shadow: bs
//German Borg: gb
//Palidor's Knights: pk
//Rolling Thunder: rt
//Roman Legion: spqr
//Slipshod Research and Mining: srm
//Steel Fury: sf
//System X: sysx
//WildCards: ace
//XenoTech: xt

//The briefing
//The first line (Title) is the name of the faction. This can be changed to
//things like a team name, a person, or whatever.
//The second line (String) is the sub-set. It is usually a bit more descriptive
//than the title.
//The third line (NoWin) is the briefing given sometime... I really haven't been able to figure out when.
//The fourth line (Default) is the normal briefing given.
//Both these lines use %s to 'fill in' bits of data:
//The first %s is the team name.
//The second %s is the team's home sector
//The third %s is the hostile faction.
//Any more than three cause a crash upon launch.
//The fifth line (SecondaryObjectives) is what is shown when there are other objectives.
//The sixth line (Conquest) is what is shown if there are multiple objectives and one is conquest. %d is the percent, and %% creates a % mark
//The seventh line (Countdown) is what is shown if there is a countdown. %d is the number of minutes
//The eighth line (Artifacts) is what is shown if artifacts are required. %d is the number of artifacts
//The ninth line (Flags) is what is shwon if flags are required. %d is the number of flags
//the tenth line (Prosperity) is what is shown if prosperity is required. %d is the credits needed.
//the eleventh line (DeathMatch) is what is shown if kills are required. %d is the number of kills.
//To create a quotation, be sure to write it as \" so the MDL interpreter knows it is not the end of the string
//To create a new line, simply type \n where the new line should be.
