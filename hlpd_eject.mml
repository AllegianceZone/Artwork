<Font|smallBoldFont>Eject Pod:<Font|smallFont> Allows a pilot to escape his destroyed ship.
Once in an eject pod, he either is automatically transported back to his base or can be picked
up by another pilot. The game owner can allow or disallow the use of eject pods in the Game
Settings screen before the game begins.<p>
