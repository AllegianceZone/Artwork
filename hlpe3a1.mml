<Font|subheaderFont>1) DEPROBING<Font|helpFont>

<p><p>When a probe is spotted, it must be taken out as soon as possible before the bomber gets spotted. The bomber stops all thrusters while one of the nans or another escorting ship flies away and destroys the probe. It also is important to keep a scout ahead to spot probes before it's too late. Of course, it's very possible that the bomber has already been detected, in which case the turret gunners can handle the probes.

<p><p><Font|subheaderFont>2) ALEPH SCOUTING<Font|helpFont>

<p><p>Before entering alephs, it is always good to know what lies on the other side. It is the nan's job to enter the aleph shortly before the bomber, and report any mine/drone/camp. Also, if a probe is close to the aleph, the bomber must be notified to stop until the probe is destroyed. Note that if there is indeed a camp, chances are the nan won't survive, and the bomber may still have to go in because the run is so crucial, and it seems reasonable that it may succeed. In this case, you have to understand that a nan going on the other side of the aleph is often a sacrifice.
