<Font|smallBoldFont>Tip:<Font|smallFont> Because players can change
their names freely on many of the free servers,
you may have a hard time tracking down a specific person. If the person is on
the MSN Gaming Zone, they probably only have one account and therefore
only one Zone ID, so they may be easier to track.
