The Allegiance Training located at <Hyperlink|www.allegiancezone.com|http://www.allegiancezone.com><Color|white> can and should be your
best friend while learning Allegiance.  Many novices fail to use the Training to enhance their knowledge.  A huge collection
of articles on a wide array of topics are all located on one site.<p><p>
It is <Font|smallBoldFont> HIGHLY SUGGESTED<Font|helpFont> you read through the Training at least once before ever playing on a regular server.
It is very frustrating to teams and especially commanders when there are people on the team who fly around aimlessly and will not
carry out/do not understand basic commands.<p><p>
It will take many readings to grasp a lot of the huge amount of information located on the Training website.  However you will become
a much better player, more aware, and more beneficial to your team.
