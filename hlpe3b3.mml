Whenever a station needs to be repaired, it is best to repair it the fastest. Equip a nanite repair system, and launch. As soon as you gain control of your ship, turn around and start repairing the station. Meanwhile, use your sidethrusters to move toward a green door, and stand in front of it. As soon as your energy is depleted, you may dock and relaunch immediately; your energy will have completely regenerated. This is much faster than waiting for the energy to recharge itself.
