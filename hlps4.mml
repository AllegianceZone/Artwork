The Combat HUD is the same for all ships. The only
difference you'll notice is the text color changes. This indicates which team you
are on in that particular game.<p><p>

At the upper center of the Combat HUD, your chat messages will appear. You will receive not only

Over the course of a game, you will receive command objectives from your commander, if your
game has one. Pending and accepted commands are shown in the upper-left
corner of your HUD.<p><p>

When a commander gives you an objective, it appears in the message stream, and the Objective
Pending icon appears in the upper-left corner. Once you accept that command, the Objective
Accepted icon appears and you'll receive an Auto-Pilot Engaged audio
cue.<p><p>
