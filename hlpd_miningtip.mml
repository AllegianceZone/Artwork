<Font|smallBoldFont>Tip:<Font|smallFont> Command new miners to mine the He3 asteroids of
forward neutral sectors before depleting the He3 in your own home sector. This way, if you
are later pushed back to your home sector, you still have a viable income source, and your enemy
may find that you've already wiped out income that they had planned on to
keep their operation on course.
