<Font|headerFont>FINANCIAL SYSTEM<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>

The income for the team is quite simple and similar to that in other RTS games. 
Credits come from various sources of income, and can be used to purchase various 
technologies, ships and pieces of equipment. There are multiple sources of income 
in Allegiance:
<p><p>
<Bullet|hlpbullet|The main income source is Helium-3, collected by miners (AI-controlled ships) that 
fly to and from the He-3 asteroids, bringing the material to the proper station or 
refinery and thus yielding a certain amount of credits.>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|A source of income unique to GigaCorp and the Dreghklar Empire is through Special 
Refineries: stations built on certain asteroids which passively produce a determined 
amount of credits every minute.>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|Cashboxes found in space by pilots also provide income. A pilot flying on a cashbox 
sends the credits directly and immediately to the team. The pilot does not need to 
bring the cashbox home, nor does he need to make room in cargo.>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|The payday is a fund given to a team by the faction's government to assist them in times of war.>

Allegiance introduces two key differences. First, there is another, constant source 
of income: the payday. Second, all the team's income is split between every player, 
who may then choose to donate to another player (usually the commander) or keep for themselves.
