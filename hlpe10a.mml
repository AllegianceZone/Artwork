<Font|headerFont>SIGNATURE:<p>Items Influencing<Font|helpFont><p><p>

The ship itself has a base signature, the one that your ship will have when it is empty. However, mounting certain equipment can raise your signature. Note that anything located in your cargo bays cannot influence your signature.

<p><p>Mounting your shields and missiles will greatly raise your signature. This is why any stealth fighter/bomber and troop transport will fly with its shields and missiles in cargo, unless the situation is particular and requires otherwise. Any ship that doesn't wish to be seen must keep both its shields and missiles in cargo.

<p><p>As a regular bomber, you'll also not want to be seen most of the time. Therefore, keeping your shields and missiles down would seem like a good idea. However, a bomber needs its shields because it is likely to undergo heavy fire. Therefore, simply unmounting your missiles might be enough. In some situations, you may need more missiles, and then you might keep them on as well, since you'll need all the cargo space you need for your turrets' ammo. You need to balance between attempting to go stealthy or have a fully charged shield right at launch.

<p><p>As a Bios bomber however, you might want to keep both your shields and missiles down, since Bios use their heavy cloak to sneak up close to enemy stations.
