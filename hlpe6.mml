Troop Transports are used to capture enemy stations at which ships can dock. As such, teleport receivers and refineries cannot be captured (despite the audio warnings that you'll get). Also, because only heavy troop transports can carry SRM EMP Missiles, standard troop transports do not pose a threat to any station unless they are assisted by bombers or galvers. Because of the tremendous effort and planning required to capture a station with a standard troop transport, they are never used.
