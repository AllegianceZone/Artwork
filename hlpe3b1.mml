<Font|headerFont>STEALTH NANNING<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>

Some ships, such as BIOS bombers, heavy troop transports and assault ships will try and enter the enemy sector without getting spotted (nans never accompany a stealth bomber). Therefore, as a nan, you must also remain unseen, or else the enemy will be very suspicious about scouts hanging around in a sector, and will investigate, resulting in highly probable failure of your assault. 
<p><p>You must therefore equip special equipment. First, do not equip your shields and missiles. You will not need missiles. Also, you are supposed to remain unseen until you attack, so the shields aren't needed until you proceed to the offensive. Keeping the shields in cargo is a good idea, and keeping 2 missiles in cargo as well can prove useful if a probe threatens to betray your ship's position. You will have enough room in cargo, because you will need much less mines (only drop mines during the short assault against the target station). 
<p><p>Also, if you are BIOS, it is obvious and very important that you bring a heavy cloak, which you will use at the same time as the ship you are protecting (when entering alephs and while you are attacking). However, make sure you don't cloak when you need to nan, because you'll deplete your energy.
