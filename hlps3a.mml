<Font|subheaderFont>REVIEWING AND SELECTING SHIPS<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>To review and select a ship at your current station<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|At the top of the Loadout, click <Font|smallBoldFont>Prev
Ship<Font|helpFont> or <Font|smallBoldFont>Next Ship<Font|helpFont>
until you find the ship you want.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|To see a list of all ships available at this station, click the down
arrow at the right of the current ship's name.><p><p>

Over the course of a tech tree game and as new technology is researched,
you'll have
access to additional ships. You'll be able to select them from your Loadout
by using the Prev Ship and Next Ship buttons.<p><p>

If the ship you wish to fly is a capital ship, you must transport yourself
to the Shipyard via the <Main|hlps11|Teleport display.> The <Main|hlpd5|Shipyard> is
where the large capital ships are launched from. You also may need
to buy the ship (see "Buying Ships," below).<p><p>

<Font|subheaderFont>UNDERSTANDING SHIP STATISTICS<Font|helpFont><p><p>

As you cycle through each ship available at your current
station, its name, description, and statistics are displayed below
its picture.<p><p>

The Ship Statistics area not only shows the overall performance
envelope of the selected ship but also how any weapon and equipment
changes affect your ship. The statistics bars allow for the maximum
limits of the various stats for the class of ship you are working with, so
if a ship
has a full statistics bar, it is the best ship in
that class for that statistic.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Max Speed --<Font|helpFont>Shows your
ship's maximum speed without using boosters.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Acceleration --<Font|helpFont>Shows how fast your
ship will accelerate under full throttle without using boosters.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Turn Speed --<Font|helpFont>Shows how
many degrees per second your ship will turn on its lateral axis.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Hit Points --<Font|helpFont>Shows the
amount of damage your ship can sustain before being destroyed.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Energy --<Font|helpFont>Shows the
amount of energy your ship carries.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Scan Range --<Font|helpFont>Shows how
far your ship can detect other objects.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Signature --<Font|helpFont>Shows the
size of the ship's signature. The higher the number, the easier it is for the ship to
be detected by enemy forces.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Armor Class --<Font|helpFont>Shows the type of
armor on the ship.<p><p>

<Font|subheaderFont>BUYING SHIPS<Font|helpFont><p><p>

Most ships are "free" once your team has spent the money to pay for their
research and manufacturing. A few ship classes, however, are extremely
expensive to create. These ship types, which are the larger capital
ships and the bombers, cost money per ship. When a ship is
labeled with a price tag, you must have the corresponding sum of money in
order to fly it. The amount of money you currently have is noted on the
bottom of the Loadout.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>To buy a ship<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|Select the ship in the Loadout, and then click
<Font|smallBoldFont>Buy Ship.<Font|helpFont>><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|The money is deducted from your account and tagged as your next launch
vehicle. Your team members will also see your ship in the
<Main|hlps11|Teleport display,> allowing them to board it as a
<Main|hlpe2b2|turret gunner.>><p><p>

If you are <Main|hlpc4c3|autodonating> to another team member,
you will have 0 credits.
In this case, clicking Buy Ship will send a request for money to the
person you are autodonating to. That person will be notified that you wish
to purchase the craft, and he will either accept or deny the use of funds
for buying the ship.
