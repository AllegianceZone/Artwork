<Font|headerFont>CAPTURING: Planning<Font|helpFont><p><p>

After asking for and purchasing your 1000 credit HTT (800 credits for IC), immediately place your EMP Missiles and Med Shields in cargo. Under no circumstances should you fly with those armed, except two, discussed later. With the ship ready to launch, you can look at the command screen and plan a safe flight path to your target. A safe flight path is one that is free of any kind of enemy sensors. 

<p><p>Generally, you or a teammate will have scouted a chosen route recently to make sure no recent probes or minefields were added. Always keep in mind that you have to fly like a stealth bomber: remain hidden at all costs or you'll have the entire enemy team after you. Conversely, because you have a higher signature than a stealth bomber and because you can't cloak, you have to be especially careful when flying, often using sector edges and rocks rather than simply cloaking as would a stealth bomber.
