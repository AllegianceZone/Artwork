<p><p>Firing your weapons and boosting are the two actions that will reveal you to anyone nearby. This is why turrets must NEVER fire unless the bomber is detected. Also, certain tactics, like a galv run, require all the fighters not to fire their boosters until they are detected, which is different from the usual flying pattern, where a pilot generally boosts if he's going somewhere. As the fighters in the galv run are detected, they can start boosting as the enemy prepares defenses.
