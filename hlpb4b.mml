<Font|headerFont>GAME OPTIONS<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>


<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Number of Teams:<Font|helpFont> You can set the number of teams from two to six. 
Note that the number of players on the server is determined by the administrator, and is divided by the number of teams 
to determine the number of players per team.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Players per Team:<Font|helpFont> Although the server administrator sets the player 
limit, the game controller can set the number of players per team within that boundary, setting both a minimum and a maximum 
using options like 1-32 or 5-10. This is important for the map type you wish to select, since maps may have team size 
restrictions. More players will change the map, adding an extra home, for example.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Skill Levels:<Font|helpFont> This option requires that statistics are available 
(like on AZ). If set to a value other than "any", it can limit the kind of player that may join. "Nov. Only" prevents 
intermediate and advanced players from joining. "No Adv." only prevents advanced players from joining.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Team Lives:<Font|helpFont> Sets the number of lives that each player has. You lose
 a life when your pod is destroyed. If the option to remove pods is selected, you lose a life when your ship is destroyed.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Starting Money:<Font|helpFont> This sets the amount of money that each team starts with.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Total Money:<Font|helpFont> This sets the amount of He3 that will be present on the
 map. A higher setting means that the map will contain more He3. Note that He3 is divided into sectors, and will be distributed
 so that a home sector contains half of the amount of a standard sector. In other words, there are twice as many He3 rocks in 
standard sectors as compared to home sectors. However, because the number of sectors changes on every map, the amount of He3 
per asteroid changes depending on the number of sectors.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Resources:<Font|helpFont> This sets the amount of tech rocks and He3 rocks in each 
sector. The numbers differ between home and standard sectors. ><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Map Type:<Font|helpFont> Maps in Allegiance consist of nothing more than a certain 
arrangement of sectors. The position of rocks and alephs within those sectors is usually randomized, and as such only 
becomes a strategic concern after the game has started. Allegiance offers a variety of maps, and the Community has designed 
tools that allow for the creation of custom maps and give a lot of freedom to map designers, going much beyond the simple 
relative positions of sectors.  A map choice is generally based on the number of players present and the kind of game that 
people wish to play. Many maps are even restricted in the amount of players that they can accomodate.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Map Connectivity:<Font|helpFont> This modifies the number of alephs in each sector, 
thereby reducing the connectivity between them and changing the map considerably.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Max Team Imbalance:<Font|helpFont> This sets the maximal imbalance that can occur 
between any two teams. Setting it to N/A is generally reserved to special games.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Stats Count:<Font|helpFont> When turned on, the statistics of the game will count 
toward the permanent statistical record of the AZ.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Allow Defections:<Font|helpFont> This allows players to change teams. It is generally 
turned off for a two-team game to keep players from joining the other team to see everything they have, and then join the 
other team. In multi-team games, however, it is turned on to allow players from dead teams to join the remaining teams rather 
than wait for the game to end.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Allow Joiners:<Font|helpFont> This option is generally turned on to allow players to 
join a game in progress.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Eject Pods:<Font|helpFont> When turned on, players whose ship explodes end up in eject 
pods rather than dead. If turned off, players die upon the destruction of their ships, and thus lose their kill bonus and one 
life (if applicable). Turning this off also removes all balance issues that involve pods (rescue probes/drones, ripcording pods, etc.).><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Allow Friendly Fire:<Font|helpFont> Simply turns friendly fire on or off. Friendly 
fire is useful to destroy probes placed in front of friendly red doors, or to place teammates in pods to rescue them and get 
them home quickly. The option is usually turned off to keep players from destroying their own bases and to make the game a bit easier.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Invulnerable Stations:<Font|helpFont> Makes all stations invulnerable. This option 
is usually only turned on for command practice Conquest games, or for games where the stations are not really involved 
(deathmatch with development turned on, for example). Note that stations can still be captured.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Development:<Font|helpFont> When turned on, there is a tech tree and the whole RTS 
aspect of Allegiance kicks in. If turned off, both teams start with a defined set of ships and upgrades and play with those 
throughout the game. Development is generally turned off for games like deathmatches, where opponents want fairly equal weaponry.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Reveal Map:<Font|helpFont> Although generally turned off during normal games, this option 
is useful during comm practice games or games with very few players to avoid having to scout big maps. When turned on, all the 
alephs are revealed, but all other objects are not (fog of war, rocks).><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|<Font|smallBoldFont>Allow Shipyards:<Font|helpFont> This option is useful for small games where capital ships 
could be overpowered. Turning it on or off simply makes the shipyard available or not in the tech tree.><p><p>
