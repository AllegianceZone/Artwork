<Font|headerFont>EMERGENCY NANNING<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>

When a miner or constructor gets attacked, it is important to destroy the attacker, but it is also very important to repair the miner or constructor. Indeed, it is very likely that you can repair the hull quicklier than it gets damaged, or at least considerably slow down its decent. This will delay the ship's death, and give much more time for the other defenders to destroy the attackers, saving the miner or constructor. 
<p><p>If you fail to repair the miner or constructor, it is higly likely that you will lose it, despite the many defense ships present, because the time it takes to kill a fleeing ship is often greater than the time it takes for the fleeing ship to destroy your utility ship, the miner or constructor.

<p><p>A situation most common with GigaCorp stations, but also applicable with most factions: galv runs. When a light station is being galved, it is useful to nan it, since it has very little hull (still much more than that of a ship). Repairing it will delay its destruction slightly, which might result in saving the structure. This applies mostly to outposts and teleport receivers. The difficulty is that many nans are needed, and many more pilots are required to take out the galvers, which makes this a team task that drains most of the pilots.
