Nans are excessively important protection ships. They repair the hull of any ship/station. They are used in bomber runs, in heavy troop transport runs, to protect constructors and miners, and to repair damaged stations. They consist in scouts mounting the EW Nanite Repair System as a weapon, which repairs damaged hulls of ships and stations, and has no effects on shields. Note that you can also repair asteroids, in extreme strategic circumstances.

Scouts equipped with the nanite repair system are referred to as nans. They usually fly behind the bomber, and repair its hull as it gets damaged by defenders. The scouts have their cargos filled with mines (either proximity mines or mine packs), which they drop along their way, to annoy and damage defenders. Loading an extra round of countermeasures is best against a team relying on missiles. Nans play many different roles.
