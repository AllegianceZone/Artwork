<Font|headerFont>STEALTH BOMBING: With Rix<Font|helpFont><p><p>

Rixian stealth bombers drop station pods, which don't need to be armed, and so don't raise their signature. This allows them to remain unseen, even when using a simple signature cloak (in opposition to a heavy cloak). Remain as far from the station as it is possible for your station pods to fire at the target. Drop your pods on this circulatory trajectory, you will never get spotted. The technique is described here. Note that your pods, however, do get spotted and can be shot down. A single defender trailing you can neutralize every single one and wait for you to reload before destroying your ship.
