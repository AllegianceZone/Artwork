<Font|headerFont>HANGAR<Font|helpFont><p><p>

You begin a game in your team's Garrison hangar. The hangar
is the same in all landable stations. When you die in combat, and
eject pods are disabled, you will find yourself back at your Garrison
hangar unless there is another station closer to your point of death.<p><p>

Your <Main|hlpd1|Garrison>, as all other stations that you can build, has armor
protecting it, shown in the upper-left corner of your hangar. In
the upper center of your hangar is the name of the station and sector
you are currently in. If the station you are in is destroyed, then you'll be ejected
in the last ship type that you flew before landing at that station. If you
happened to
have just entered the game and the station you're in is destroyed,
you'll be
ejected in the first default ship in that station's Loadout screen.<p><p>

The message stream in the upper center of your
hangar is the same message stream you'll see while flying any ship.<p><p>

All the various in-game displays that you can access while flying your
ship can also be accessed from within your hangar, by either clicking
their location in the hangar or pressing the
corresponding key. In addition, the hangar is where you access your Loadout screen and
Teleport display.<p><p>

<Font|subheaderFont>LAUNCHING<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>To launch your ship from a station hangar<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|In the hangar, click the Quick Launch hangar
door.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|If this is your first time to launch into the game,
you
will launch in the default ship and loadout, often the Scout. If this is
not your first time, you will launch in the same ship and loadout you
previously launched with.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|-or-><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpimg1|In the hangar, click the Loadout screen, or press
F4.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpimg2|Select the ship you wish to fly, and then modify your
weapons and equipment if you desire.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpimg3|To launch, click
<Font|smallBoldFont>Launch.<Font|helpFont>><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|If you modified your weapons and equipment but then
decide you want to launch with the default loadout configuration, click
<Font|smallBoldFont>Default Loadout.<Font|helpFont>><p><p>

<Font|subheaderFont>LANDING<Font|helpFont><p><p>

There are two ways to land your ship at a station: in autopilot and
manually.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>To dock at a station hangar in autopilot<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|Press B to target your base, and then press P to engage
autopilot.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|Autopilot will take your craft all the way home and actually dock in
the proper hangar opening.><p><p>

It is not advisable to use autopilot to land in the midst of enemy bogies. Autopilot
will still work, but it is rather slow as it turns you into your hangar,
making you a sitting duck.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>To dock at a station hangar manually<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpimg1|Approach a station and look for a green hangar
opening.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|Make sure the hangar has flashing green lights. If
the lights are flashing red, move away as quickly as possible, as this
is an exit hangar and you might get a face full of launched ship.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|If your ship is a capital ship, you'll need to land at a
Shipyard,
as it is the only station that can handle these large craft.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpimg2|Make sure your motion indicator is pointing directly
at the hangar, and then fly into the hangar opening. Pointing in your true
flight direction is more important than your speed.>
