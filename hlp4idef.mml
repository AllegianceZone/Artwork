<Font|smallBoldFont>Teleporting:<Font|smallFont> Perhaps the most underutilized feature of
Allegiance, teleporting is your means of relentlessly beating down the enemy. A forward
deployed Teleportation Receiver and another back near the base make it easy for pilots to
zip out, stir up trouble, high-tail it back for reloading, and then zip out again to the
front line. If you've opted for the supremacy strategy, we recommend building Teleportation
Receivers in almost every sector.
