<Font|headerFont>CONSTRUCTORS: Defending<Font|helpFont><p><p>

It is vital to defend constructors since they are let your team expand and control the map. Without them you cannot control the map. The commander will most likely assign someone temporarily to this task.

<p><p><Font|smallBoldFont>Take a scout with a nanite gun<Font|helpFont>
<p>A scout with a nanite gun armed can quickly repair a constructor under attack. Make sure to stay out of sight though if you are continuously escorting the constructor or the enemy will target you quickly if they are just starting their attack run. Scouts are the best constructor defenders if not already at the constructor under attack (so the enemy will not immediately target you).

<p><p><Font|smallBoldFont>Order the constructor to the base or to a defending player<Font|helpFont>
<p>The faster the constructor reaches a base or a defending player the less chance it might be destroyed. So quickly target and order it using F3 (sector view) or F6 (team listing) to bring it to safety.
