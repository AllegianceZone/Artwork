<Font|helpFont>If you are a team commander, you have access to additional functionality that the other players do not see:<p><p>

    <Bullet|hlpbullet|<Color|yellow>Team Settings<Color|white> displays the Team Settings screen, where the team leader can modify the team name and select which faction the team will represent. Using non-ASCII characters in Team names is forbidden.>
    <Bullet|hlpbullet|<Color|yellow>Team Ready<Color|white> can be selected to let everyone on all teams know that your team is ready. This can be selected even if a player is away from the keyboard (AFK). Once all team leaders have selected the Team Ready option, the game owner can start the game.>
    <Bullet|hlpbullet|<Color|yellow>Auto Accept<Color|white> is an option to automatically accept all players who request to be on your team. Turning this off requires that when the request to join, you must add them by hand.>
    <Bullet|hlpbullet|<Color|yellow>Accept Pilot<Color|white> is the option to accept a player who is requesting to join your team. When a player tries to join your team and Auto Accept is not selected, that player's name will flash and his status will change to "requesting.">
    <Bullet|hlpbullet|<Color|yellow>Reject Pilot<Color|white> is the option to reject a player who is requesting to join your team. When a player is rejected, he is booted back to the "not on a team" roster, from where he can try to join another team.>
    <Bullet|hlpbullet|<Color|yellow>Make Leader<Color|white> is the option to make the selected player the team commander. The first person to join a team is considered the team leader at the creation or setting of a game. The team commander is always placed at the top of the team roster. There will be times when you'll be made team leader due to people losing their connection. Use this button to make someone else the commander. Make sure you find a new commander first before going to Not on a Team to avoid making an AFK player the commander, which can stall or ruin a game.>
