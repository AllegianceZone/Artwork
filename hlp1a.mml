Earth as we knew it is no longer. Only a cracked, floating hulk now orbits our sun.
March 13, 2140, was the last day of humanity's existence on Earth.
A misdirected asteroid crashed into Earth, cracking its mantle and destroying nearly 95%
of the world's population. Those few who survived did so by making it into the reaches
of space -- but now those survivors are forced to fight for survival
among the various factions amid the stars.<p><p>

Now the remnants of humanity must ally themselves with one of these factions to
survive. So to whom will you declare your "allegiance" in your fight for survival
in the unforgiving depths of space?<p><p>

Allegiance offers gameplay at different levels:<p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|In Allegiance Zone arenas, you are a solo
pilot in search of glory through one-on-one ship
combat. There is no tech tree to construct and your home base is
invulnerable -- you focus completely on your dog-fighting skills and doing
what it takes to become ranked the number-one pilot. This gameplay is for
<Secondary|hlpd_allegurl|Allegiance Zone> members only.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|In a tech tree game, you jump into more team-oriented gameplay. You'll
want to invest in the research, development, and upgrades. You'll want to fly the
proper ship for the proper job. You can play this through the Allegiance
Zone or set up on your

<Bullet|hlpbullet|In a squad-based game, you and your squad war with other
squads to see

registered and ranked against all other Allegiance Zone squads.><p><p>

The numerous game settings will always give you a different
experience each time you play Allegiance.<p><p>
