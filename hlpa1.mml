<Font|headerFont>ALLEGIANCE<p><p><Color|white>
<Font|helpFont>Allegiance is a game corresponding to massively multiplayer online games. Allegiance is unique in that it also has Commanders, 
bringing a more-than-complete Real Time Strategy (RTS) aspect to the game. The <Secondary|hlpdefcommander|commander> is the one who should receive all the 
money, who should order around the <Secondary|hlpdefminer|miners> and constructors, and who chooses technology, invests money, organizes the team. 
All in all, he's the boss, and you report to him.<p><p>

The number of players involved in a game can have dramatic effects on what type of strategy is going to be used. A small 
game will be played on a small map, without too many resources, and small assaults, whereas big six-teamers may reveal secret 
alliances between factions, assaults using fleets of capital ships, multiple surprise, stealth assaults coupled with teleport 
assaults, huge battles, sector overloads, and a lot more resources.
