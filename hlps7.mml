<Font|headerFont>MAP DISPLAY<Font|helpFont><p><p>

The Map display shows all sectors that your team has discovered so far.
A line between two sectors means that an aleph connects them.
Note that if the game owner selected Reveal Map in the Game Settings
screen, all alephs will be revealed at the start of the game.<p><p>

display<Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpbullet|Press F7 or SHIFT+F7.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|The expand/collapse arrow in the upper-right corner of
the Map display toggles the size of your Map display between expanded and
mini. The expanded Map display includes information on asteroids and mining operations.><p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>The Sectors --<Font|helpFont>In the actual map of the
Map display, color-coding and various border
styles around the sectors indicate the current status of each sector.<p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Sector in a Team
Color:<Font|helpFont>
Indicates the team that has control of that sector.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Sector in Black:<Font|helpFont> Indicates that no team
has control of that sector.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Gray Border:<Font|helpFont> Indicates the sector
you are currently in.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Green Border:<Font|helpFont> Indicates
that sector is the location of your command objective.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Red Nonflashing Border:<Font|helpFont> Indicates a
sector that you can teleport to. When you access the Teleport display (F8) in the hangar,
all sectors you can teleport to will appear with this border in the Map display. When you are
in-flight and press and hold the R key, the sectors you can teleport to
will appear with this border in the Map display; the sector you will
teleport to will have a heavier red border. To change the sector
you will teleport to, click the sector you want to teleport to
while holding the R key; your teleport countdown will be reset.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|Red nonflashing borders will also appear around
sectors in the map that contain an asteroid that a selected constructor
can build on. Likewise, as you roll your cursor over a building
in the Investments display, sectors where it can currently be
built will also appear with a red nonflashing border (the
exception to this is any building that requires a generic
asteroid).><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Red Flashing Border:<Font|helpFont>
Indicates that a conflict is currently underway in that sector.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Red Flashing Star Border:<Font|helpFont> Indicates
that an enemy bomber is in that sector. This star border will alternately flash with a
plain red border if the sector also has friendly fighters.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Yellow Flashing Star Border:<Font|helpFont> Indicates that
one of your miners or constructors is at risk in that sector. This
star border will alternately flash with a plain red border if the
sector also has friendly fighters.><p><p>

<Bullet|hlpblank|<Font|smallBoldFont>Red/Yellow Flashing Star Border:<Font|helpFont> Indicates
that one of your stations is at risk in that sector.><p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Sector Name --<Font|helpFont>Pausing your mouse cursor over any sector
in the Map display will display that sector's name at the top of the Map display. If you click
a sector in the Map display while in the hangar, that sector will then become the sector shown
in your Command view. If, as commander, you need to provide a command to a player and the
command objective is in another sector, select the player, then the command in the Command bar,
then the objective sector in the Map display, and finally the objective in
the main Command view display.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Sector Icons --<Font|helpFont>The row of icons below
the sector name indicates the types of craft and objects currently in that
sector. For a list of these peripheral radar icons, see the Survival Card
that game with your game.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Station Icons --<Font|helpFont>Beside each sector is an icon for each
station you have located in that sector. This is limited to a maximum of 10 icons, even though
you can have more than 10 stations in a given sector.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Player Icons --<Font|helpFont>A small dot near a sector represents a
player in that sector. The color of the dot indicates the team the player belongs to.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Total Helium3 Amount --<Font|helpFont>(Expanded map) Shows the total
amount of Helium3 that your team has mined within the selected sector.<p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont>Asteroids --<Font|helpFont>(Expanded map) Shows the number of each type
of asteroid your team has located within the selected sector.<p><p>

When the actual map becomes larger than the Map display can show, you can scroll the map. When you
move your cursor off of a sector at the edge of the map, the cursor will turn into a hand, allowing
you to "grab" the map by selecting the hand on the map and dragging it in the direction you want.
