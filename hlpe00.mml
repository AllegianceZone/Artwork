<Font|headerFont>ABOUT QR
<Font|helpFont><p><p>The QUICK REFERENCE section is designed to provide quick in-game reference on basic Allegiance tactics.  However, due to the work involved in creating a totally redesigned help menu, most sections in this release were taken from the Academy.  
<p><p>A future release will replace the current QR section.  The goal will be to provide a quick overview on each topic, readable in about a minute.  When a novice is asked to perform a task he is unfamiliar with, such as nanning, he/she can look up the QR associated with it, read it, and apply the knowledge to the current game.
<p><p>More in-depth learning is to take place by reading the <Main|hlpa2c|Academy> and participating in <Main|hlpa2d|@Cadet>.
