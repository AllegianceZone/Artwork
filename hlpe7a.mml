<Font|headerFont>GALVING: Offense<Font|helpFont><p><p>

A good setup for a galv run is very important or it will surely fail. It’s important that the fighters in question assemble in base and launch at the same time or assemble at the aleph of the sector that has the target base in it. When enough fighters are ready, wait for the signal and go in or launch and do not boost until detected by the enemy (eyed). 
<p><p>Make sure you don’t fly into mines dropped by scouts in front of the bases, a slight diagonal path works wonders, but stick together! Then when in range fire away and make sure you keep moving, use the base as a shield from the defenders, but be careful of mines. With enough participants the base will surely be destroyed and rip out if no miners fly out of the base so you can swiftly participate in the next galv run. Use voice chats to direct the galv run more effectively.
