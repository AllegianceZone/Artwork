<Color|red><Font|smallBoldFont>NOTE:<Font|helpFont>Commanders are able to partial invest on their own.  This section describes the commander giving others money to invest, but this is no longer required.
<Color|white><p><p>Usually, not donating to the commander will get you in trouble. You are keeping your team from valuable 
income. The only way the commander can retrieve that money by force is by kicking the non-donating 
player. There are certain situations, however, where not donating is recommended. A single player 
is told, by his commander, to stop donating. That player is then also given small amounts of money to invest.
