<Font|headerFont>EJECT PODS: Killing<Color|white><Font|helpFont><p><p>

<Font|smallBoldFont><Color|yellow>There only exists one strategic reason for pod killing:<Font|helpFont><Color|white> remove a high kill bonus. (There's another, non-strategic reason: revenge.) The general rule is that any pilot with a kb of 28 or higher must be killed. Any pod with a lower kb must be allowed to live, so that the pilot is kept in the pod, unable to help his/her team. Note that Bios pods are killed with lower kbs, because those pods can get home quickly through ripcord. Because Bios pods are going to be home quickly anyways, you might as well pod kill them with lower kill bonuses since it's not much of a difference to them in terms of the time to get home (this does not apply if they do not have a home teleport receiver, in which case the Bios pods can't get home quickly either).

<p><p>If you are preparing an attack, keeping all enemy pilots in their pods, even those with high kbs, is a good idea. It will increase the chances of success of your assault. This is why, when many enemy pilots have been podded, pilots will order others to not kill pods, so that they remain stranded and unable to defend while you're bombing.
