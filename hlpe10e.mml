<Font|headerFont>SIGNATURE:<p>Using enemy sensors<Font|helpFont><p><p>

If you're defending a miner, chances are you won't be detected by the enemy. If, however, you suddenly become detected (an eye appears on your HUD), you can tell that an enemy scout or stealth fighter has probably entered the sector and is relatively near. If you really know your stuff and remember the enemy's ships' scan ranges by heart, you can even use your signature to calculate the maximal distance that the enemy is from you. If you're only human, however, get ready for possible combat, and call for help if you feel it's required.

<p><p>Similarly, if you wish to verify enemy presence in a sector, you can raise your signature using your weapons and boosters, and see if you become detected. If not, surely there is no enemy nearby. If you get an eye, the enemy has either a probe, ship or station nearby. This is also useful for certain tasks that require you to remain unseen.
