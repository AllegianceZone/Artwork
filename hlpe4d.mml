<Font|headerFont>BOMBING: With Bios<Font|helpFont><p><p>

The BIOS possess a very useful asset that affects most of their ships, the capacity to equip a heavy cloak. BIOS bombers and scouts can therefore use the cloak to further decrease their signature. Activating a heavy cloak will cause the signature to drop to ridiculously low levels for a short time, often making the bombers and their nans invisible, even when surrounded by enemy ships. Use the cloak wisely to avoid being seen. You can even travel hiding behind asteroids, using the cloak between each asteroid, and your nans doing the same. Sometimes, even when firing your missiles, the heavy cloak will make you invisible. 

<p><p>If you wish to perform this trick, it is best to disengage your shields when they are depleted, since they no longer protect you but still raise your signature. You can therefore remain unseen even in the middle of a swarm of defenders with turrets firing. The best pilots can successfully bring a whole bomber run (1 pilot, 2 gunners, 4 nanites) within 2500 meters of the enemy station without being detected at all: a surprise attack that can literally not fail. Note that BIOS bombers can be used more or less as if they were stealth bombers, only with turrets and nanites. They are however slower and have much less cloak time.
